# AIP-ND (AI programming with Python - NanoDegree)
Udacity May > July 2018

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

PURPOSE:
Image Classifier Python app. application should be a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line.
          
> Train a network on a data set with train.py
        Prints out training loss, validation loss, and validation accuracy as the network trains
        Use GPU for training: python train.py data_dir --gpu
          
> Predict flower name from an image with predict.py along with the probability of that name.
          A single image will be passed /path/to/image and return the flower name and class probability.
