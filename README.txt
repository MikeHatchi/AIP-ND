102 Flower Category Database
----------------------------------------------
This set contains images of flowers belonging to 102 different categories. 
The images were acquired by searching the web and taking pictures. There are a
minimum of 40 images for each category.

The images are contained in the file 102flowers.tgz and the image labels in
imagelabels.mat.

We provide 4 distance matrices. D_hsv, D_hog, D_siftint, D_siftbdy. These
are the chi^2 distance matrices used in the publication below.

The database was used in:

Datasplit
------------------------------------------------
The datasplits used in this paper are specified in setid.mat.

The results in the paper are produced on a 103 category database. The two
categories labeled Petunia have since been merged since they are the same.
There is a training file (trnid), a validation file (valid)
and a testfile (tstid). 

Segmentation Images
------------------------------------------------
We provide the segmentations for the images in the file 102segmentations.tgz
